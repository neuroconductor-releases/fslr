Description: Wrapper functions that interface with 'FSL'
        <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/>, a powerful and
        commonly-used 'neuroimaging' software, using system commands.
        The goal is to be able to interface with 'FSL' completely in R,
        where you pass R objects of class 'nifti', implemented by
        package 'oro.nifti', and the function executes an 'FSL' command
        and returns an R object of class 'nifti' if desired.
